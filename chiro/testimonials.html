OUR PATIENTS DO!!!</strong> </p>
      <hr />
      <p align="left">I’ve had arthritis in my hip and neck for many years, back pain and a very painful shoulder.  An orthopedic surgeon told me I would need a hip replacement.  I’ve gone to chiropractors before with only minimal results.  As the pain was increasing, I was taking more pain medication.  I saw an ad for a free evaluation with Dr. Barnes and took advantage of it.  When I came to see Dr. Barnes, he stressed the need for a program to prevent any further damage and possibly reverse some damage.  I needed to make the commitment to the program.  I liked that strengthening exercises went along with the program.  That made sense to me.  Since I’ve had these problems for many years, I was skeptical that much could be done.    Happily, I was wrong.  I’m off constant pain medication, I’m walking without pain and generally feeling much better.  I had another surprise. I’m getting arthritis in my hands and it was causing me a lot of pain.  I just happened to mention it to Dr. Barnes and he started working on my hands.  At first it was very painful.  He works on them now and I have no pain and I have much more flexibility in my hands and fingers.  I’m not 100%, but I’m 100% pleased with my progress.  I have very little need for pain medication and I feel great.  I can continue with my favorite sport, skiing.  I might mention I’m not a young chick, I just turned 69 and I hope to be skiing for many more years.  I believe Dr. Barnes can help me do that.  
        
        P.S. I think I’ll “just happen” to mention my aching ankles!!

      <p align="left">I had battled carpal tunnel syndrome and low back pain for TEN YEARS!!  I had the surgery for carpal tunnel, seen neurologists, hand specialists, and orthopedics…
        ALL TO NO AVAIL!!  Chiropractic has been the only successful treatment.  I had been to another chiropractor and thought I was getting excellent care, but I really feel as though I’ve made more progress at Barnes Family Chiropractic in just a short period of time.  I like the amount of time and attention shown to me by the doctor and his staff.  I also like the fact that I’m not being rushed in and out, as well as Dr. Barnes’ clear and thorough explanation of my condition and my treatment plan.  I will absolutely recommend Barnes Family Chiropractic.

      <p align="left">I came to Barnes Family Chiropractic because I had a severe muscle spasm in my lower back and was not able to walk.  I also had daily headaches, or at least 3 – 4 times a week since childhood.  I was taking many medications for relief, but the headaches continued.  Since I started chiropractic care, in just 3 weeks I have been headache-free, except for a few hours of a slight headache.  I was referred to this office when I talked to Dr. Barnes during a spinal screening event and decided to try chiropractic treatment.  Dr. Barnes and his staff are very kind and really care about how you feel and your health.  They showed me such kindness and consideration when I couldn’t even take one step.  They are like this to everyone who comes into their office.  They also explain everything to you in very plain English, so you can understand everything about your body and how they can help you feel better and live life to your fullest.

      <p align="left">I came to see Dr. Barnes with sinus problems, allergies, migraines and tingling in my arms and legs.  Over the course of my treatment, my symptoms have improved greatly.  I haven’t had any sinus infections and my migraines are extremely few and far between.  The numbness and tingling in my arms and legs has lessened considerably.  I feel healthier and my immune system functions much better.  I have gotten over colds much faster than I used to.  Dr. Barnes is a great person.  He is very caring and honest.  He gives me an excellent and detailed adjustment every time.

      <p align="left">After six months of putting up with the constant numbness and burning sensation up the back of the head and along the right side of my head, I came up with the idea to go to see a chiropractor.  I had never been to a chiropractor, but after seeing for different medical doctors, and having an MRI done and still no answers as to what was causing this numbness, I figured I needed to give the chiropractor a chance.
        
        This was the best decision I ever made!  After being treated 3 times a week I could feel the difference within 2 weeks.  I feel so much better thanks to Dr. Barnes!  I would recommend chiropractic to anyone in pain. It definitely works!!  Dr. Barnes and his staff are very professional and pleasant.

      <p align="left">When I first began treating at Barnes Family Chiropractic, I had neck pain and severe sinus pressure and headaches.  I have been visiting Dr. Barnes as prescribed, and am following all of his instructions.  Now I can freely move my neck and the sinus pressure is not a problem anymore.  I’ve also noticed that I am now sleeping all through the night.  Thank You Dr. Barnes!!!

      <p align="left">When I started care at Barnes Chiropractic I had been enduring neck pain, jaw pain blurred vision, headaches, dizziness, hand pain and low back pain that radiated to my hips and legs. My symptoms all started following an automobile accident 3 years earlier.  I had treated with a neurologist, my family doctor, 3 different physical therapists, as well as 3 other chiropractors.  No one could get to the root of my problem.  With Dr. Barnes, I have seen major improvements.  I have more confidence while driving because I can now move my neck to look over my shoulders without turning my whole body.  My ability to concentrate has increased.  I don’t have the radiating low back pain.  It is now much easier to get in and out of bed and I sleep better as well.  I just have tons more energy.  Dr. Barnes if by far the best doctor I have seen.  I would recommend him without hesitation.

      <p align="left">I have suffered with many problems for over thirty years.  I had headaches every day from my teenage years.  I have had numerous problems with by low back, neck and shoulders.  I also have Fibromyalgia, which can be very debilitating.  I would wake up feeling like I was hit by a truck.  After seeing Dr. Barnes, I am thrilled to say I am feeling 1000% better.  I travel over 30 miles each way to the clinic but it is worth it!!  This has been the best experience of my life!!

      <p align="left">I have a severe scoliosis (aprox. 40%) that was diagnosed when was 12 years old.  Over time and with a car accident it had worsened.  I had constant low back pain, severe asthma, allergies and headaches I thought I just had to live with.  My orthopedic doctor gave me a back brace and some exercises and said nothing could be done short of surgery.  I did not like those options.  I tried Dr. Barnes as a last hope.  He was very honest with me and took control of my condition.  Not only did my low back pain improve but almost immediately my headaches were less severe and less frequent.  I could literally breathe easier.  As my asthma let up, I no longer needed my inhaler.  Dr. Barnes is a very sincere professional you certainly can trust oh help.        </p>

      <p align="left">My initial visit with Dr. Barnes was because I had a problem which is probably the case with most individuals who come to seek his expertise.  I was suffering from back pain from a fall that had aggravated an existing condition.  From past chiropractic care, I knew my spine wasn’t in the best of shape but I was still able to “get by” albeit with some discomfort.  My thought was that if it wasn’t broke, don’t fix it.  I soon found out how wrong this line of thinking could be.  Due to this recent trauma everyday movements like sitting, standing and laying down was accompanied by significant pain that would take my breath away.  To be honest, the reason I chose Barnes Chiropractic was because the office is close to my home and being in so much pain and discomfort, I wasn’t sure I would be able to tolerate a long drive for treatment.  In hindsight, it was one of the best decisions I ever made!   After my first adjustment, I had almost instant relief from the pain in my back and down my leg.  From the initial call to the office and with each successive visit, I have been treated as a person and not a dollar sign walking through the door.  Everyone has gone above and beyond to make my experience a pleasant one.  They take the time to answer my questions, explain the various treatment modalities and work with my insurance so that I can get the best, affordable care.
        
        I have recommended Dr. Barnes to family members and friends and would highly recommend him to anyone who is seeking chiropractic.  My heartfelt thanks go to Dr. Barnes and his staff for all they have done for me and continue to do with each walk through the door!<br />

      <p align="left">I was suffering with extreme TMJ pain, severe headaches, and dizziness.  I had been to a dentist and an ear, nose and throat specialist before finally finding Dr. Barnes.   Since I began treatment at Barnes Chiropractic my TMJ is completely gone, my headaches are almost non-existent and much less painful.  My dizziness is gone as well.  I can finally get a good night’s sleep!  I have so much more energy and feel much better in general.  My results with Dr. Barnes has been outstanding.  I love the consistent care with no drugs.
