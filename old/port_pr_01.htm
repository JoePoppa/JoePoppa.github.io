                        <p>PNC Bank has requested a wide variety of marketing 
                          posters over the years. This piece was part of a strategy 
                          for them to encourage a positive mind set for PNC Bank 
                          employees.</p>
                        <p>The heart logo in the center was something I'd developed 
                          earlier on for the client. They had asked for a logo 
                          that would be loose and friendly, to print onto plaques, 
                          posters, mouse pads and more. I provided several options, 
                          and they chose the logo in the center of this poster. 
                          The design of the logo then prompted the design of the 
                          poster itself.</p>
                        <p>This poster was printed out 2'x3'. Even the script 
                          font text was legible at quite a distance.</p></td>
