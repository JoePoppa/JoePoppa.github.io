                          is one of four developed for Pearson Education so they 
                          could market their new Security training internally 
                          across the company. After Pearson Education chose the 
                          adventure island theme from among many proposed, I worked 
                          with them to have sketches approved and develop this 
                          3D Island Game board. They wanted a warm, positive association 
                          for this courseware. Incorporating the renderings of 
                          this custom 3D Model into large posters was just one 
                          of the many ways this asset was reused.</p>
